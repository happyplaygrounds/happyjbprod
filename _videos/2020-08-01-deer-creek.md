Deer Creek

This playground, completed in the summer of 2020, is the largest project to date for the Happy Team. With 43000 SF of play space, this state-of-the-art inclusive play space offers a multitude of options for all children, and beautiful poured in place surfacing.

We worked closely with MA+ Architecture to ensure the design and colors complimented the architecture of the building. CMS Willowbrook were the construction managers, and what a pleasure it was to work with them!  For a million dollar plus playground, this project proved to be virtually problem free, thanks to the team we have in place.
